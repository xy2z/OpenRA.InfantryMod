## About
This is a mod for __maps__ in [OpenRA](http://www.openra.net): Red Alert.

Only infantry is available in this mod, along with a couple super weapons such as paradrops.

The goal is to capture and control as many oil derricks as possible, until a team reaches the winning points.

This currently works on OpenRA version **20170421**.

## Maps
[See a list of all InfantryMod maps on the resource center](http://resource.openra.net/maps/?category=Infantry&sort_by=latest&with_problems=show&players=).

## Rules
- No MCV. Only barracks.
- All infantry is available. Default price.
- Barracks health is set to 8000 (up from 600)
- Oil derricks health is 20000 (up from 1000)
- Super Weapons: parabombs, paradrops and spy plane.
- Get points by capturing and controlling oil derricks. (see Points below)
- Capturing an oil derricks gives $50 and then $25 every few seconds.
